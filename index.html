<h3 class="bold-text"><strong><font size="5">WHAT IS A DOMESTIC AIRLINE?</font></strong></h3>
<p>A domestic flight is also known as an &#39;internal flight&#39;, or &#39;local flight&#39;, and are flights that leave and land in the same country.

<h2 id="faqs"><span class="uppercase">Nigerian domestic flight FAQs</span></h2>
<h3><font size="5"><strong><font size="4">Do I need to carry a passport for domestic flights in Nigeria?</font></strong></font></h3>
<p>This depends on the airline you&#39;re flying with. A form of identification or Nigerian National ID card is sufficient enough to travel within Nigeria.

<h3><font size="5"><strong><font size="4">What is the baggage allowance on Nigeria domestic flights?</font></strong></font></h3>
<p>Baggage allowance depends on the airline you are flying with and the airport you are flying from. Make sure to check your baggage allowance with the airline you are travelling with directly or look at your e-ticket as sometimes the routes and aircraft that you may be flying on may mean the baggage allowance varies. It&#39;s also quite significant to check the width, height and length restrictions of the baggage so that you aren&#39;t being charged for excess baggage amount at the airport check-in.</p>
<h3><font size="5"><strong><font size="4">What time do I need to check-in at the airport for domestic flights in Nigeria?</font></strong></font></h3>
<p>Depending on the airline you are flying with and the airport you are flying from, check-in times may vary. For domestic flights, the check-is often a later than it is for international flights as travellers normally need less time to get through the immigration and border controls at the airport.</p>
